#QuickSort
The JavaScript file contains code that will use quicksort. This works by utilizing a "pivot" point on an array. All values on the left side of the pivot that are higher than the pivot will be switched with values on the right side of the pivot that are lower than the pivot. This procedure is when carried out on the left and right side of the pivot until the whole array is sorted.
